# Introduction
This is a demonstration of common math operations with large strings represented as integers.

Float is not supported.

Currently supports these operations:
 1. Addition ``+``
 2. Subtraction ``-``
 3. Multiplication ``*``
 4. Division ``/`` *
 5. Modulo ``%``*
 6. Power ``^``
 7. n-th Root ``r``\
 *Extras:
 8. Square Root ``sqrt``*
 9. Cube Root ``cbrt``*

**Results as integers, ``b`` is limited to long long.*

Note: for most cases in competitive programming, if the calculation is too high, consider using ``unsigned long long`` ``(10^19)``,
or using more efficient algorithms.

Only using these algorithms as a last resort.

# Using the source code
Download the entire source code as zip and open it with CMake and your C++ compiler configured.

If you're planning to copy one or more operations, please read the source code carefully and copy the functions in appropriate header(s).
