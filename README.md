# Introduction
This is a demonstration of common math operations with large strings.

Note: for most cases in competitive programming, if the calculation is too high, consider using ``unsigned long long`` ``(10^19)``,
or using more efficient algorithms.

Only using these algorithms as a last resort.

# Using the source code:
Download the entire source code as zip and open it with CMake and your C++ compiler configured.

If you're planning to copy one or more operations, please read the source code carefully and copy the functions in ``toBignumString.h``.
